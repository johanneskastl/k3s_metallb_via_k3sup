# k3s_metallb_via_k3sup

vagrant-libvirt setup for a k3s cluster without servicelb, so metallb can manually be installed 

This is loosely based on what Adrian Goins showed in his wonderful [Youtube video on HA k3s](https://cncn.io/2021/03/ha-k3s-with-kube-vip-and-metallb/) and what is in the [k3s up and running](https://community.suse.com/courses/4522316/feed) course (see challenge 4 - Replace ServiceLB).
